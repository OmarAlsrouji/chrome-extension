# chrome-extension
This is a project I did while learning JavaScript, where I relied on manipulating the DOM and the local storage to create a chrome extension that captures the active pages's url and store it in the Local storage, this serves as a on-the-go note for storing urls that the user is going to use in the future.

Upon pressing "Save Tab", the url is copied from the tab and is displayed on the extension.
After pressing "Save Tab", the user can save the url by pressing "Save Input", thus storing the url in the local storage.
In order to delete unwanted urls, the user can press on "Delete All".
